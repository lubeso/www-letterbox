I thought of you awhile ago.

Biking back home from Boston, I saw a woman crossing the street.

Her hair, her glasses&hellip; to simply say "she reminded me of you" couldn't fully express what crossed my mind.

I wouldn't guess her age, but I could see the soft wrinkles in her smiling face.

For that brief moment, I felt as if I'd caught a glance of the future.

She made think about who would you be decades from now&hellip;

She made me wonder whether I'd be there to see you, whether I'd witness the journey in between.

I get so caught up in the future, neglecting my persistent absence in the present lives of those I hold dear.

How can I expect see your aging smile when I'm not here now?

How can I expect others to keep me in their lives when I offer them nothing more than a fading memory?

What am I trying to say? What do all of these words mean?

This human existence means nothing to me; I am frustrated with no reprieve, alone in my thoughts.

The only reason I've found worth living is people&hellip;

People who give me memories worth replaying over and over&hellip;

People who give me futures worth waiting for&hellip;

Thank you for being one of those people.

The same thing I've told you a million times before&hellip;

Nothing is forever, and nothing is certain, but I certainly hope I will witness the future I saw that day.
