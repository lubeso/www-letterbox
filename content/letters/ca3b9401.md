Not many people can make you forget the weather&excl;

All the time with you&comma; I didn&apos;t mind the rain&hellip;

How many different ways to say &quot;happy to see you&quot;&quest;

Not sure&comma; so I might repeat myself from time to time&period;

You owe me nothing&hellip;

Your presence and memory is more than enough&excl;

All I can hope for is to see you again soon&period;
